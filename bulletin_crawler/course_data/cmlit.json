Universal themes and cultural values, along with individual differences, will be discussed and compared in works from such authors as Homer, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, and Marguerite de Navarre. Comparative study focuses on the understanding and appreciation not only of the individual works, but also of their influence on other literary works and artistic forms and the ways in which they relate to their cultures. You will articulate and compare interpretations of texts spanning 2500 years of Western literary history. The variety of the Western tradition will lead you to an understanding and critical discussion of the process by which certain works become regarded as \"great.\" This course will also allow you the pleasure of encountering a wide variety of creative literary expressions from three distinct periods.

CMLIT 113 / JST 113 / CAMS 113 / RLST 113 Myths and Legends of the Jews (3) (GH;IL) The impact of the Bible on Western Culture is immense. Beyond its religious importance, the motifs and images from its myths and stories permeate literature and art, providing a basic frame of reference that for much of history could be taken for granted. A degree of familiarity with these motifs so as to be truly fluent is no longer common, and so it requires special effort to discern allusions to biblical traditions. Moreover, these traditions are not static: religious communities continually re-interpret them and appropriate them in very different contexts. Many prominent traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not appear explicitly anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, but are the product of imaginative and ingenious interpretation and re-tellings. Why, for example, is Noah an example of a righteous person in Christian tradition, but in rabbinic tradition is more often portrayed as a profane, earthly-minded man who was saved only because he was the least bad of an evil generation? Why is Moses commonly portrayed with horns in medieval art? Underlying such different traditions are centuries of debate and reflection on these texts as sacred scripture, and competing religious communities often authorized their distinctive beliefs and practices by reading them into scripture. The differences are often too subtle to discern apart from careful comparison. This course will explore the boundaries between Scripture and tradition by means of a close examination of the myths and stories in the Hebrew Bible and their subsequent interpretation and re-tellings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Using methods from comparative mythology and folklore, as well as comparative midrash, our procedure will be to compare these traditions closely with the biblical text, asking: What are the main motifs in the mythology of Judaism? Does Judaism have a coherent mythology? How do their myths compare with the myths of their neighbors? Where did these myths come from? How do these traditions relate to the Bible? What was the function of these myths? Why are there competing myths? How is it possible that Judaism affirms belief in only one God, but has myths that include other divine beings? We will also compare with later interpretive traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). Can we trace trajectories of interpretation? Can we discern particular interpretive methods in operation? We will seek to answer: what do these re-workings of the traditions tell us about the development and function of Scripture, and the social circumstances of the communities? Finally, we will seek to detect reflections of these interpretive traditions in literature and art from the medieval to the modern periods. The course is organized around major topics in the Jewish Scriptures: God, creation, heaven and hell, Torah, Sabbath, Abraham and other ancestors, Israel and holy land, exile, and Messiah.

We begin with early attempts to classify living things for example, Aristotle and Pliny. We then see how medieval bestiaries appropriated classical ideas about nature while adding to them in the context of Christian historia. In the Enlightenment, Linnaeus's taxonomic work provided a new way of naming and systematizing organisms. On the other hand, the nascent scientific methods of Sir Francis Bacon anticipate the shift from the descriptive to the theoretical and mechanistic that accompanied Darwin's first sketch of a phylogenetic tree and the theory of evolution. We consider new theories, methods, and language in our examination of Watson and Crick and the double helix, molecular biology, and genomics.

Beginning with the medieval period and ranging to the early 20th century, the course will examine the variety of communities where public and private often intersected and which sponsored innovations in the arts. Often indexing social movements and political change, such communities include convents and cathedrals, royal academies and courts, coffee houses, salons, and theaters. Artists, performers, patrons, politicians, journalists, and others collaborated and competed in these spaces. Such communities could embody political and economic power, or foster resistance to it. This approach to the history of the arts in western culture puts the focus less on the individual creative genius of great composers, writers, painters, and sculptors, and more on the social exchanges and institutions that sponsored and received their work. Such an approach brings to light particularly the ways in which women played significant roles in the production and reception of culture: as salon hostesses, patronesses, and divas, women often enabled and enacted cultural production. Some examples of particular units of study might include: the German convent of Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), where monophonic chant and allegorical morality plays developed; the Mantuan (Italy) court of Isabella d'Este ,the first lady of the world, (1474-1539) where the roots of the madrigal began and where notable painters found support and sponsorship; the French salons of Mme. Geoffrin (1699-1777) and Mme. de Staël (1766-1817); and the student residences in Madrid where avant-garde writers and artists interacted. Each unit will also consider the relationships between the aesthetic norms and values of a period and the economic and political realities of sponsorship. The course will require that students attend at least one musical performance or concert held on campus during the semester and complete a brief writing project based on that experience. This requirement will encourage students to think about their own university as a contemporary space of cultural sponsorship.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: HIST 240Q, IT 240Q, WMNST 240Q", "International Cultures (IL)", "General Education: Arts (GA)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "Honors", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning", "GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "295", "credits": "1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Supervised off-campus, non-group instruction including field experiences, practica, or internships.

LTNST (CMLIT) 403 Varieties of Latina/o Cultural Expression (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course provides students with a multi-faceted comparative view of Latina/o literature in relation to other forms of cultural expression. First, the course presents a variety of cultural expressions to students in an effort to teach them the different ways that form affects content. Each text will be studied in its historical context as well, thereby providing students with a sense of Latina/o cultural history. Second, this course compares works from within the same genre, allowing students to recognize the ways that Latina/o culture has worked to build identity, to deconstruct identity, and to challenge cultural stereotypes. Such comparison further facilitates comparison of the ways that different cultural forms have been used by diverse Latina/o communities. Third, this course compares cultural forms, allowing students to see how Latina/o poetry affects music or how Latina/o theater affects novels Fourth, this course will include texts that represent a variety of linguistic and national contexts, including many countries in Latin America, thereby allowing students to see the relationship between history, culture, language, geography, and identity. These are all themes that are at the center of both Latina/o Studies and Comparative Literature. A comparative perspective facilitates appreciation of the vast and varied ways that Latina/o communities have used cultural expression. A particular point of contact between Latina/o Studies and Comparative Literature is the influence of hybridity. A central issue explored in this course concerns the intricate connections between multiple ways of expressing identity, in the arts, literature, music, etc., in diverse circumstances, such as locations where Latina/o cultures may be in the mainstream (such as in Latin America) and in the minority (in the U.S.). Drawing upon approaches offered by comparative literature and theories such as post-structuralism, feminism, and post-colonialism, we will examine the complex process through which Latina/o culture has been defined, disseminated, contested, and commercialized. Of particular interest from a comparative perspective are the ways that Latina/o cultures are created through hybridization, processes of mutual borrowing and differentiation, as well as through transnational processes of migration, urbanization, and cultural contact. The course's objective is to show not only how complex societies consolidate a shared culture but also how diverse Latina/o communities have produced a multiplicity of cultures that have been expressed via a broad range of cultural registers. These communities often span vast geographical areas, not only in the U.S. but across the Americas as people continue to look to their countries of origin for artistic inspiration.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in the humanities or in any LTNST course, or   4th-semester proficiency in Spanish", "other": ["Cross-listed with: LTNST 403", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "United States Cultures (US)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "404Y", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Selected works from the major poetry, fiction, and drama of such countries as India, China, Japan.

Students will develop a broad array of interpretive skills appropriate to poetry and poetics; they will acquire a knowledge of a wide variety of poetic forms; they will undertake comparative analyses of poems and poetic structures; they will learn how to think about poetics outside poetry.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in literature", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "480", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Traditional tales from various parts of the world: their origin, characteristics, forms; their transmission as oral narrative and written literature.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in literature or folklore", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "486", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Development of tragic drama and its relationship to social background and philosophical theory.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "487", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Development of comic drama and its relationship to social background and philosophical theory.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "488", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Study of major traditions and writers in European drama of the early to mid twentieth century.", "prerequisite": "ENGL 15", "other": ["Cross-listed with: ENGL 488", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "489", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "A survey of developments in contemporary world fiction in translation.  CMLIT 489 Contemporary World Fiction (3) (IL) The purpose of this course is to expose students to the developments in world fiction in the last 50 years and to expose them to a range of authors from a number of countries. This course, then, also involves getting to know the novel-writing histories of those countries and in many cases, the recent histories of those countries (for example, in novels like Rushdie's Midnight's Children or Garcia Marquez's Hundred Years of Solitude). The class will approach these fictions from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Pamuk, Grass, Murakami, and Marquez. Time allotted for the study of the works under consideration will vary.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in literature", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "490", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "A comparative look at the nature and history of video games as cultural artifacts, from Pond to online role-playing.  CMLIT 490 Video Game Studies (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The video game industry is larger than the film industry, and yet the academic study of video games has only just begun. This course is a comparative introduction to the nature and history of video games as cultural artifacts, from Pong to online role-playing. It introduces students to academic discussion on and creative work in new digital forms including hypertexts, video games, cell phone novels, machinima, and more. Studentswill learn basic narrative theory, and study its impact on game studies and game production. They will survey major debates over the meaning and value of video games, and review its history from Pong to contemporary games, including online world-based games. The course extends students' skills in literary interpretation to a variety of new objects, and makes them aware of the role medium plays in aesthetic development and production. Students will leave with a far sharper understanding of how the interpretivetools used in the humanities can be extended to include new media, and with a sense of the historical role video games have played and will continue to play in global cultural production.", "prerequisite": "GAME 140", "other": ["Cross-listed with: GAME 460", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "491", "credits": "3 Credits/Maximum of 3", "description": "A comparative, international study of adapations between literature and other media (film, theater, photography, music).  CMLIT 491 Literary Adaptations: International and Comparative Perspectives (3 per semester/maximum of 6) (IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.From the very first expressions of literary impulses in prehistoric times, and continuing through the present, literary material has been re-used and creatively recycled through processes of adaptation and appropriation, often involving translations not only between languages, but also between media. This course uses a global perspective to explore the processes and aesthetics of adaptations of literary works, including adaptations into other genres or media, such as the visual arts, a film, opera, stage play (or vice versa adaptations from other media into literature). Drawing upon a broadly international selection of materials, we will explore multiple discourses surrounding adaptation; address the importance of translation and the dynamics between languages, audiences, and texts; study how adaptations address common themes such as race, class, gender, and sexual orientation; discuss international taxonomies of literary genres; and critically assess different cultural notions of authorship, intellectual property, and communal vs. individual ownership. From year to year the works and authors studied in this course may change. Course objectives include (1) to encourage students to think critically about adaptations within and between cultures and media, in different parts of the world (2) to critically evaluate several of the often conflicting analytical paradigms which characterize the study of literary adaptations; (3) to assess varied approaches to genre in adapted works in different cultural settings; (4) to understand different perspectives on the concept of the author, such as the literary author and the 'author' in theatre studies; (5) to question assumptions about the world, re-examine personal points of view, and understand an expanded international range of ethical and value systems as expressed in literature. For methods of student evaluation, see the syllabus for each section; options include class presentations, response papers, research projects, and exams. This course may form part of the Comparative Literature major, the World Literature minor, and other majors.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in literature or other fields relevant to this course", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "494", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "494H", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "Honors"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "496", "credits": "1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Creative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "497", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities"]}, {"department": "CMLIT", "number": "499", "credits": "3-6 Credits/Maximum of 6", "description": "Advanced courses offered on comparative literary topics as part of a foreign-study program.", "prerequisite": "18 credits or equivalent in the appropriate foreign language;   6 credits in literature or related field appropriate to this   course", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)"]}]
