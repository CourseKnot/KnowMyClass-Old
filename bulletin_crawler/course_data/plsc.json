It considers what ideologies are, what they do, and how we can study them. Each ideology is examined with respect to its historical origin; the major ideas, thinkers, events and political activists associated with its genesis; and how it has developed and changed in response to new circumstances. Students learn to think about ideologies as distinct from parties, regimes and political actors, and to establish criteria for classifying them in order to observe their influence on and through political action and organization. As the belief systems that underlie or justify political action, ideologies include views about human nature, history, and the scope and purpose of government. Ideologies implicitly or explicitly suggest an ideal form of socio-political organization that articulates who owes what to whom and establishes criteria for evaluating the status quo.

In some cases, it is presented as a troubled, violent, dangerous place, as a place permeated by long-standing hatred between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. In others, the focus is on the state's role as the center of Judsiam--a home of the \"chosen people\" and the source of inspiration for one of the world's great monotheistic religions. Some present it as a model for how a democracy can succeed under trying demographic, historic, and geopolitical circumstances. Others frame Israel as a place of conflagration (armageddon) that will usher in a messianic period or as a nation-state with a discriminatory regime that privileges its majority population over its minority and administers oppressive policies over Palestinians in the occupied territories it captured in the 1967 War. While there are elements of truth in each of these presentations, the full picture of Israeli society is much richer and more complex. This course teaches students to cut through the mythology, and develop a more accurate understanding of what Israel is in the 21st century. Since Israel is a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse society, it is only possible to understand the true nature of modern Israel through exploring the many sub-groups that comprise the Israeli citizenry. The course looks at Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews (both religious and secular), Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis, Russian-Israelis, Bedouins, and Druze. For each group, it looks at demographics, background histories, migration patterns, institutions, cultural norms, values, and practices. We will look at what is important to each group, how they see and organize themselves, and how they understand and experience the world around them.

Every first-year seminar in Political Science focuses on several of the major questions of the field. Many of these questions concern the constitutional arrangements of governments: What is it that we want governments to do, and what is the ideal government arrangement? Why does every nation (and every state and city) have somewhat different constitutional provisions for legislation, judicial, military and executive functions of government? What can we learn from careful comparisons of different types of government? What is unique to the American system and what are the consequences of this uniqueness? Other questions concern power: To what extent do wealthy individuals and wealthy organizations have disproportionate power in society? Is this appropriate or not? What is the impact of governmental attempts to limit the influence of the wealthy? We are also very much interested in the international system: What types of foreign policies and diplomatic strategies reduce the likelihood of war? What is the role of international organizations (such as the UN or World Bank) and multinational corporations in shaping conflicts between nations? Finally, we are interested in ordinary citizens: Do citizens know enough to formulate rational opinions on public issues? Why are many citizens apathetic? What motivates citizens to support one candidate over another or to favor particular policies and philosophies? Each first-year seminar will select a special topic of interest and use that topic to explore a subset of these questions in order to provide a challenging introduction to political science. In the course of doing so, each first-year seminar in political science will also introduce students to specialized materials (such as government documents), library resources, and appropriate electronic media. In addition, each seminar will emphasize the standards of evidence, logic, and critical thinking required to develop effective and persuasive reports and oral presentations. Students will write essay exams and one or more written reports on the relevant topic of their own choices. Class participation is required.

Those reach from violent radicalization to arctic transformation, as well as include technology trends. All of those have an impact on security in our daily lives, in the public sector, and in the private sector. Together, both states and individuals are confronted with many pressing and often competing local, national, and global security challenges that demand thoughtful responses and solutions. Particularly challenging is the need to put in place security measures while ensuring that they do not infringe on the values they aim to protect. The multifaceted security crises of our time is rooted in a broad spectrum of hazards. It among other things stretches across lone wolf terrorists, natural disasters, public health emergencies, transnational organized crime, and cyber attacks; and it includes global counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and environmental change. All of those represent significant problems facing our world today. At the same time, they provide opportunities for us to bring about changes that will significantly increase the ongoing quality of life around the world. In order to do so, it is essential to develop analytical skills for risk assessment, policy analysis and strategy development. Critical thinking skills are also crucial since we need to be able to identify security gaps, unreasonable securitization trends, and point out fallacies of reasoning and misrepresentation of facts that may occur when responding to security threats. In this course, we will review the historical evolution of security studies, national and international security policies and strategies, human security and security management in business and industry. Further, in the rapidly changing world of security studies, it is important to understand the critical differences between concepts like strategic security, counterterrorism, protection, intelligence, homeland security, criminal justice, conflict studies, emergency management, threat assessment, human security, crisis management, disaster management, and related terms. Based on this, students will learn how security issues relate to their chosen academic discipline and professional goals.

Although governments must always attend to urgent matters that cannot be put off, government attention is, and perhaps should be, directed as well toward matters that are of fundamental importance. However, there is substantial disagreement about what those matters are. In this course, through brief summarizing readings and through lectures, students will encounter the arguments of various political philosophers making the case that one or another purpose is most essential to government. Among the candidates for the status of primary purpose of government will be civic and moral education, the defense of life and property, the dismantling of the economic foundations of inequality, and the institution of justice in accordance with universal moral principles. The compatibility of the various conceptions of the purpose of government with the experiences and aspirations of women will receive special attention.

It is often said that politics is a dirty business, meaning that unethical behavior is prevalent in politics. But this is often said with a twinge of disappointment, sometimes with bitterness or anger. We wish that it were not so. One part of an effort to improve the ethical character of politics is to strive for a clear understanding of what ethical political action is. This course endeavors to arrive at that understanding by considering some of the most profound and influential ways of understanding ethical action. One example is that which is derived from Aristotle and supplemented by Martha Nussbaum. Another example is that which is derived from the writings of Immanuel Kant.

Real-world attempts to convince various audiences will be analyzed with respect to their appeals to the emotions of their respective audiences, often through framing the candidacy or policy under consideration in ways intended to stimulate fear, hope, or anxiety in order to command the attention of audiences. The use of words, other symbols, and non-verbal stimuli with strong emotional and normative content will be highlighted. The class will also evaluate efforts to establish credibility with audiences through references to endorsements, demonstrations or claims of expertise, goodwill, and good sense. Lastly, the logical validity of inferences and deductions made in the attempts to convince will be considered so that flattery, manipulation, bargaining, deception, and intimidation can be distinguished from genuine persuasion. Materials presented in Philosophy 10 (GH), \"Critical Thinking,\" to which PLSC 114 is linked, will provide students with the tools to do this. So that students might see how characterizations of attempts to convince might be placed into a provisional context, the study is comparative. It will look at attempts in the U.S. as well as some other country. In general, so that the attempts at winning over audiences might be as comparable and as comprehensible as possible, the issue should be as similar as possible and the other country should be Anglophone. Although systems of elections and governance and controversial issues inevitably vary within and between countries, it is possible to find elections and policy controversies with sufficient similarities to make cross-national comparisons of attempts at convincing their respective audiences a fruitful exercise. For example, one might build the course around the televised debates and campaign ads for the mayoral elections in Vancouver and Seattle and the efforts to generate support and opposition to oil pipelines in the two countries. By looking at the different strategies used in attempts to convince elites, the citizenry and parts of the citizenry in the two countries, it is possible to raise questions about the workings of the political systems in the two countries. Specifically, students can examine some of the ways that historical geopolitical, constitutional, economic, and demographic differences between and within the two countries are manifested in the political processes of the two countries. By leading students to consider such questions, this course can induce them to undertake further study that will equip them with the methodological tools to investigate these issues in greater depth. Moreover, by providing students with the basic outlines of well-supported valid inference and challenging them to detect of the most common informal fallacies in efforts to convince and create an outline for their own attempt at political persuasion, PLSC 114 (GS) will help build capabilities that are necessary for responsible and effective and ethical citizenship.", "other": ["General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "General Education - Integrative: Linked", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"department": "PLSC", "number": "120N", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Alexis de Tocqueville called association the Â¿mother scienceÂ¿ of politics and saw voluntary associations as a pillar of American democracy.

PL SC 404 Analyzing Public Policy in the American States (3) Developing public policies is the proximate goal of any government. In the United States national, state, and local lawmakers steeped in their own traditions, procedures, and political environments establish rules that determine their citizen's quality of life. In the states specifically, laws affect citizens's access to and their ability to afford an education; the quality of the roads they travel on; the wages they earn; whether and to what extent they qualify for subsidized health care; how they cast their ballot in elections; and myriad other aspects of their lives. This course focuses on policymaking in the American states and how those policies can be evaluated using social science methods. The course begins with a discussion of what makes states distinct from one another & their populations, governmental institutions, and political values. The focus then shifts to how statistical techniques can be used to describe variation in state policy; to develop causal arguments to explain variation; and to assess the efficacy and value of different approaches to the same social problems. Students learn how to measure and gather data relevant to public policy debates, to describe and categorize policy, to model policy outcomes, and to draw conclusions about alternative approaches to solving the policy problems being addressed. Students then apply this knowledge to major policy debates in state government. The course concludes by with an exploration of the ethical implications of using data to make policy decisions and with attention to how technical and statistical information can be effectively communicated to professional and nonprofessional audiences.

PL SC 414 Dictators and Their Demise (3) Dictators and Their Demise provides a broad exploration about how non-democratic governments throughout the world rule. We examine: the conditions that give rise to authoritarianism; the variety of authoritarian regimes; the strategies authoritarian leaders use to stay in power; the consequences of different types of authoritarianism for outcomes such as economic growth and human development; and the domestic and international sources of authoritarian demise. The course covers cases of authoritarian rule in: Chile, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and the former Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC). The course builds knowledge about the governments under which most people in the Global South lived during the 20th century. Even today, roughly half of the world's population lives under some form of non-democratic government. Yet almost all courses currently in the curriculum, particularly in the field of comparative politics, focus exclusively on democratic forms of government. This course therefore examines a new topic not currently offered in the curriculum. In additional to learning about different types of authoritarian rule, students form an understanding of how common foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, foreign aid, and human rights shaming, are likely to affect domestic politics in these countries. This knowledge helps students critically evaluate foreign policy relationships between democracies, such and the United States, and dictatorships. Course materials cover theoretical approaches to the study of authoritarian rule, in-depth case studies (including novels, biographies, and documentary), and empirical research. This course requires student presentations, weekly reading assignments, descriptive analysis of quantitative data in graphs, multiple written assignments, and a final take-home essay exam. Students develop analytic skills through the weekly written homework assignments in which they apply the broad theoretical concepts to analyze counter factual situations from specific cases of authoritarian rule. Oral presentations develop inter-personal skills and require students to research specific cases of authoritarian rule currently in the news. This helps students critically evaluate current events. Finally, the written assignments require students to develop skills working with real data. Students collect and graphically present basic descriptive data about economic and human development in non-democratic countries: economic data, infant mortality, literacy, and indicators of women's well-being.

Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development.

These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a \"racial\" difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with \"tribe\". Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict.

In this course, we will discuss the current democratization trend in Africa by focusing on the experiences of African countries.The course is divided into three sections. Part One considers a range of factors that affect politics in Africa. We will discuss in depth the following factors: colonialism, nationalism, the relationship between state and society, ruler-ship, the military, political parties, and economic development. Then, we will consider the experiences of our four cases, to gain a historical background. In part two, we will focus on democratic transitions. We will discuss the factors that enable transitions to occur, as well as the process that transitions follow. Then, we will consider four transitions: two that resulted in the installation of a democratic government (Nigeria in 1979, Sudan in 1986) and two that ended in continued authoritarianism (Angola in 1992, Kenya in 1978). Part three considers the prospects of democracy. We will discuss the probability of a democratic transition occurring in the near future.The goals of this class are four fold. First, students will gain detailed knowledge about four African countries. Second, we will learn how to compare countries. Third, students will have a better understanding of the democratization process in general, and will be able to explain or predict democratization beyond the four cases discussed in this class. Finally, the experiences of these four countries offer a deeper understanding of what democracy is and provide students with greater flexibility to fulfill requirements in either the African and African American Studies major or the Political Science/International Politics major.

We will explore the international politics of culture and the politics of international culture, considering questions of what constitutes culture, whether it is ever entirely separate from politics, and how that separation has evolved over time. These larger themes of the course will be tackled by following the historical movement of concrete objects and people throughout the region.

PL SC 488 Comparative Public Policy (3) Comparative Public Policy is an upper level political science course that includes components of comparative politics, public administration, and descriptive economics. The course presumes that developed industrial democracies confront common challenges in meeting human needs and that policy comparison is worthwhile despite distinctive societies and political cultures. For example, government involvement in the provision of health care varies widely from Britain's National Health Service to the largely private approach of the United States. Nevertheless all health care systems confront rising technology costs, an ageing population, and rising performance expectations. A primary purpose of the course is to consider the origin and development of individual country programs while assessing the common challenges. Cross national comparison becomes relevant to the course by including some available data on costs, implementation and outcomes. Because the course includes about six distinct areas, e.g., education, taxation, urban planning income support, and overall macroeconomic policy, the course will depict profiles of policymaking in Europe, North America and Japan. Ideally comparison should help students to evaluate the effectiveness of policy choices of a particular country and government. A second objective of the course will be to examine the national approaches to the relationship between the state and private economic activity. Not only does government expenditure amount to nearly half of some country's total output, government choices create distinctive legal environments for business activity. Antitrust, health, wage, and consumer regulation offer an excellent point of comparing different incentives for economic activity in the United States and Europe. Apart from policy choices mentioned in the first paragraph, the regulation of economic activity has cumulative results for employment and the distribution of income. This portion of the course is intended to be somewhat more elementary than the first because of the probability that students will be less familiar with its content. The primary objective will be to help students understand the variations among market economies and reasons for their description as \"neo-liberal,\" \"social market,\" or \"corporatist.\" Finally, the course will examine some current ideas about recent changes in the global economy and their consequences for national policy. Clearly \"globalization\" has become a matter of political concern owing to its consequences for the creation of wealth, employment, growth and distribution. While the course cannot devote detailed or exclusive to the European Union, Europe's response to rapid movements in short term capital and investment presents an interesting point of comparison with the United States and Japan.
