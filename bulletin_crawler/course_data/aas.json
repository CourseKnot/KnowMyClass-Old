[{"department": "AAS", "number": "100N", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course offers an introduction to the history, literature, culture, and social conditions of Asian Americans. It begins with Chinese immigration to the United States in the nineteenth century and proceeds to cover the histories of other groups: Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Indian Americans. In addition to history, students explore some of the literature of Asian Americans and examine the legal and sociological aspects of the Asian American experience. The course also addresses several central questions: How much have Asian American groups held in common, culturally and historically, with one another? What role did prejudice play in the attempted citizenship and acculturation of different Asian American groups? How did Asian values and traditions shape families and communities over time? How did the experiences of Asian American women differ from those of men? What contributions to American life - food, literature, politics, education, business, science, and physical culture - have Asian Americans made? AM ST 160/AAS 100 is an interdisciplinary course that introduces students the history, society, and cultural achievements of Asian Americans.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: AMST 160N", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "United States Cultures (US)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking"]}, {"department": "AAS", "number": "428", "credits": "3 Credits/Maximum of 6", "description": "A seminar on the literatures and cultures of Asian America, with attention to forms of geographic, historical, and ethnic diversity.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: ENGL 428", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "United States Cultures (US)"]}]
