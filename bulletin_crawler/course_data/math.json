Sets and formal logic are modern concepts created by mathematicians in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries to provide a foundation for mathematical reasoning. Sets and formal logic have lead to profound mathematical discoveries and have helped to create the field of computer science in the 20th century. Today, sets and formal logic are taught as core concepts upon which all mathematics can be built. In this course, students learn the elementary mathematics of logic and sets. Logic is the symbolic, algebraic way of representing and analyzing statements and sentences. While students will get just a brief introduction to logic, the mathematics used in logic are found at the heart of computer programming and in designing electrical circuits. Problems of counting various kinds of sets lead to the study of combinatorics, the art of advanced counting. For example, if a room has twenty chairs and twelve people, in how many ways can these people occupy the chairs? And are you accounting for differences in who sits in particular chairs, or does it only matter whether a chair has a body in it? These kinds of counting problems are the basis for probability. In order to calculate the chance of a particular event occurring you must be able to count all the possible outcomes. MATH 37 is intended for students seeking core knowledge in combinatorics, probability and mathematical logic but not requiring further course work in mathematics.

This level of abstraction is essential since it is in the background of functional analysis, a fundamental tool for modern mathematics and physics.

The geometric study of algebraic equations is one of the oldest and deepest parts of mathematics, and it lies at the heart of modern developments in geometry, algebra, number theory and physics. Students completing MATH 437 will understand many new algebraic and geometric ideas by studying examples of curves defined by equations of degrees 2 and 3 in the plane. Fist come conics (given by equations of degree 2 in two variables). Rigid motions, similarities, and affine transformations give different classifications of them. New ideas then show how to get a conic through any five points and prove Pascal's theorem about six points on a conic. Special cases suggest extension of the usual plane to the projective plane, with \"points at infinity,\" homogeneous coordinates, and projective transformations.The main part of the course turns to equations of degree 3 and their singularities, flex points, tangents, and degeneracies. Several new ideas, both algebraic and analytic, are brought in to prove the existence of complex flex points on singular cubics and then real flex points on nonsingular real cubics. There is then a classification on complex projective cubics by a single parameter and finally a full classification of all real projective cubics.As time permits, relations to further topics are sketched: addition of points on a nonsingular cubic, Mordell's theorem, doubly periodic functions, and Fermat's last theorem.The course is typically taken by mathematics majors.", "prerequisite": "MATH 230", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Quantification"]}, {"department": "MATH", "number": "441", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Determinants, matrices, linear equations, characteristic roots, quadratic forms, vector spaces.

This course will develop the mathematical techniques needed to investigate such differential equations. These techniques include the study of equilibria, stability, phase plane analysis, bifurcation analysis and chaos. The course will assume prior knowledge of ordinary differential equations at the MATH 250/251 level; this is the only prerequisite for the course. We will focus on understanding and interpreting the behavior of the solutions to the differential equation models rather than on deriving the model equations themselves. Evaluation will be based on midterm exams, a final exam, graded homework, and graded longer projects which may involve computer work. The course should be of interest to any science or engineering major and some models will be chosen to reflect the fields of interest of the class.

MATH 450 Mathematical Modeling (3) The purpose of the course is to introduce mathematical modeling, i.e., the construction of mathematical structures which capture relevant physical phenomena. The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course should be accessible to students with some basic knowledge of mathematical analysis and differential equations.

Logic forms the foundation of all mathematical reasoning. To prove a mathematical theorems, one deduces them step by step from basic principles, called axioms, or from other statements previously deduced. Each step of a proof has to be a logically valid rule, such as, for example, the modus ponens: \"If A holds, and A implies B, then B holds.\" In Math 457, students will learn how concepts such as axiom, theorem, proof, and truth can be formulated as a mathematical theory, that is, logical reasoning will be studied as a mathematical subject. The simplest kind of logical system is propositional logic. Here, the basic components are whole statements which are either true or false, and which can be combined using logical connectives such AND, OR, or NOT to form new statements. Its simple nature makes propositional logic a good system to introduce many of the basic ideas: syntax and semantics, proof systems, completeness and compactness. However, propositional logic does not capture mathematical reasoning adequately. Therefore, one considers (first-order) predicate logic. Students will learn how formulas are formed according to syntactical rules. They will also study how a mathematical theory is defined as a set of formulas, how a proof is formally defined, and what constitutes a proof system. The syntactical notions above are contrasted with mathematical semantics, which considers structures over which formulas can be interpreted. This way, one can rigorously define whether a formal statement is true in a given mathematical structure, in which case we say the structure is a model of the statement. For example, the integers with addition are a model of the statement \"for every x there exists a y such that x+y =0\". A central goal of mathematical logic is to explore how the syntactical side (formulas, axioms, proof systems) and the semantical side (mathematical structures such as the additive group of integers) interact. Two fundamental results in this regard will be covered: the completeness theorem says that one can prove a statement from a set of axioms if and only if the statement is true in any structure satisfying all axioms. The compactness theorem, in turn, is an important consequence of the completeness theorem. It has profound implications for the existence and construction of mathematical structures.
