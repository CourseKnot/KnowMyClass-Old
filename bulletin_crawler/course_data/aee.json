AEE 100 Agricultural Education Orientation (3) The purpose of the course is to allow students to explore the profession of teaching in both formal and non-formal settings. Students are provided opportunities, through class activities, projects, and on-site observation of teaching and learning situations, to explore the various aspects of teaching and learning. Through individual and group-work techniques students are provided the opportunity to investigate their potential interest in becoming a future educator of agriculture. Students study the history and philosophies associated with agricultural education within the state and nation. A cornerstone of the course includes instruction that allows students to understand the requirements to become certified in the state of Pennsylvania to teach Agricultural Education. This certification allows individuals to teach Agriculture in the public school system. Along with certification requirements for teaching, students investigate what it means to join the professional ranks of teachers, and the responsibilities associated with educating today's youth. Students also learn the many techniques for teaching in, and about, agriculture in today's society through actual teaching scenarios with their peers. Students plan and implement lessons related to the many areas of agriculture including, but not limited to horticulture, agricultural mechanics, animal science, plant science, forestry, wildlife, and biotechnology. During the course of the semester, students visit various agricultural education settings for observational purposes. The students investigate what is happening in the local agricultural education program related to the three major components of an agricultural education program; Classroom/laboratory instruction, FFA, and Supervised Agricultural Experience. These observation hours may be counted towards the Entrance to Major requirements for the Agricultural and Extension Education major certification requirements."}, {"department": "AEE", "number": "201", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Study of concepts of self identity, values and interpersonal relations as related to professional and personal life. The purpose of the course is to aid students in becoming competent in conducting interpersonal relationships in their daily life, and to help students acquire skills basic to becoming a leader in their personal life. The following topics will be addressed. A framework for interpersonal skill development sets the stage for improving one's interpersonal skill. Understanding individual differences addresses information that is the foundation of effective interpersonal relations. Interpersonal communications deals with skills in sending and receiving messages. Developing teamwork skills sensitizes the student to a vital set of skills in the workplace as well as organizations. Group problem-solving and decision making provides additional skill in collaborative efforts. Cross-cultural relations and diversity develops cross-cultural skills in the classroom, community organizations and the work place. Resolving conflicts develops skills in finding constructive solutions to differences of opinion and disputes with others. Becoming an effective leader addresses: 1) exercising effective leadership in clubs, organizations and the workplace, 2) motivating and helping others to develop and grow through coaching, counseling and teaching, 3) using power and influence for constructive purposes, and 4) translating ethical behaviors into usable skills. Each class meeting will focus on one or more concepts related to leadership and interpersonal skill development. Students will be provided a number of experiential activities that help them practice a particular set of skills. In addition, students will be required to complete a service learning project applying their leadership and interpersonal skills with individuals in the community who are in need of their help.", "other": ["General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Creative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"department": "AEE", "number": "204N", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "The objective of this course is to explore the nexus of scientific discovery and societal understanding.

Although many scholars have put forth definitions for what it means to be scientifically literate, most agree it involves not only technical subject matter, but the ability to evaluate and interpret scientific evidence, and developing the capacity to engage civically in science matters. Accordingly, this course is designed to provide the foundational content knowledge necessary to understand scientific principles, as well as the experiences and discussion necessary to elicit the skills of a critical thinker and informed consumer. Scientific (e.g. genetic engineering, evolution, pesticides, climate change) and social science (e.g. human psychology, persuasion, critical thinking, policy making) subject matter will be explored through a variety of methods such as lecture, case study, discussion, and scholarly and popular press readings. In order to exercise skills in science literacy, students will engage in a variety of applied activities which include: conducting a critical analysis of a food advertising campaign, developing a policy recommendation concerning an agricultural issue, and interviewing the public on controversial agricultural topics.
