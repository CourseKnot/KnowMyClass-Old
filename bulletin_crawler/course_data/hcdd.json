The course is practice-based, which means that it instructs more abstract concepts through practical activities and practice-based inquiry. Students will learn how to apply cognitive models and philosophical concepts to real-world problems. This approach has the dual benefit of (1) highly engaging pedagogy and (2) the production of portfolio-quality deliverables that students will be able to use to secure internships and entry-level positions in industry. Students will gain skills for synthesizing and communicating design implications as well as presenting work in multiple contexts (e.g. live presentations vs. bite-sized portfolio pages). The format of the class will balance project work with tests, quizzes, short essays, and discussions on key topics. It will also include readings and some short lectures."}, {"department": "HCDD", "number": "113S", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "HCDD 113S provides a rigorous introduction to the theories, models, and tools that inform Human-Centered Design and Development.

The course will provide students with all the elements for a toolbox they can use to design and create both prototypes and working applications, and some analytic methods they can use to perform basic evaluations. The course will emphasize iterative design and the benefits of employing a cycle of analyze - design - built - evaluate in close cooperation with prospective technology users and other product stakeholders. In addition to more practice-oriented skills and knowledge, the course will provide students with an appreciation for some persistent design challenges including managing design trade-offs, ensuring universal and international access, working with others on co-design, and receiving and delivering design critiques.

The course is intended for seniors who have successfully completed the core courses. The capstone projects will integrate knowledge gained in technical subjects such as usability engineering, software construction and engineering, and mobile computing as well as general information technology topics such as machine learning, data mining, data integration and visualization, and privacy and security.
