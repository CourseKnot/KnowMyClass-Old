This course will thus seek to examine East European Jewry from the inside and from the outside. We will see how a minority community weathered the storms of modernity, while at the same time noting how their experiences reflect on the broader culture and forces around them. We will look to examine the entire East European Jewish landscape, but with particular attention to Russia and Poland. In addition to the textbooks, we will read articles on economics, culture, politics, gender, religion and literature, as well as reading primary documents. Students who complete the readings and written assignments and participate in class should expect to expand their knowledge of the East European Jewish past as well as enhancing their skills as historians.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: HIST 147, JST 147", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "International Cultures (IL)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"]}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "197", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "199", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "296", "credits": "1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Creative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses."}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "297", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "299", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "399", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "494", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis."}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "494H", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Supervised student activities on research projects identified on an individual or small-group basis.", "other": ["Honors"]}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "497", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest."}, {"department": "SLAV", "number": "499", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction.", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)"]}]
