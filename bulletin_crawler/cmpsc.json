These principles and strategies for realizing them will be illustrated through an analysis of common security issues and pitfalls in the software development process. The course will cover a variety of programming languages including C/C++, Java, and scripting languages; different classes of systems including standalone applications, client/server systems, and peer-to-peer applications; and development issues specific to different operating systems. Students will develop and analyze programs that demonstrate security principles, strategies, coding techniques, and the use of tools that can help make code more resistant to attacks."}, {"department": "CMPSC", "number": "445", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Applied machine learning techniques are used in many different areas, such as the classification, visualization and analysis of data, clustering, and understanding of natural languages for human-computer interactions. These applications are crossing the boundaries of computer science and data science. Big technology firms have all started offering their own cloud machine learning platforms. This course will start with an overview of supervised and unsupervised learning, and introduce the associated libraries. It covers basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on K-nearest neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-means, and implementation using Python libraries. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques including n-gram models, grammar, parse trees, and part-of-speech tagging will be discussed. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply Python predictive modeling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will also look at more advanced techniques, such as neural network, feed-forward network, back-propagation and deep learning with cloud AI services. Technological differences between using cloud services at a higher level of abstraction and coding locally will be discussed. Students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset, manage and understand data, and engineer features to meet that need. Students will work in teams to develop web applications that use industry standard cloud services provided by one of the AI cloud service providers."}, {"department": "CMPSC", "number": "446", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Data Mining is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, and trends, in large data sets. This course is designed to provide an overview of the data mining process, with an emphasis on data management, pattern discovery, and cluster analysis. Data management includes data selection, cleaning, clustering, visualization, and distributed data storage and processing. The course covers pattern mining concepts, including pattern discovery concepts, efficient pattern mining algorithms, and graph pattern mining. The classification problem is illustrated through decision tree algorithms and ensemble methods. Basic concepts of cluster analysis are introduced, followed by typical clustering algorithms, including partitioning methods, hierarchical clustering, and graph clustering. Applications of cluster analysis are also covered.

This course is intended as a senior-level course for computational majors such as computer science and computer engineering since it covers the exploitation of programs based on computer architecture, systems, and software concepts. First, software engineering considerations associated with a variety of software vulnerabilities will be analyzed, along with defensive programming techniques to avoid such vulnerabilities. The next part of this course will introduce systematic software engineering principles for building secure software to defend its attack surface, such as reference monitors, privilege separation, information flow, and program verification. The third part will focus on methods for security testing of software including fuzz testing, symbolic execution, grey-box testing, and forensics. The final week of the course will examine adding security into the software engineering life cycle. The design and implementation of techniques to develop reference monitors, information-flow secure programs, testing mechanisms and enhancements, as well as defensive programming against prominent software vulnerabilities will be studied and analyzed. Upon completion of the course students will be able to critically analyze the design and implementation of software for security flaws and build security mechanisms to prevent exploitation of such flaws."}, {"department": "CMPSC", "number": "448", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Evaluation and use of machine learning models; algorithmic elements of artificial intelligence."}, {"department": "CMPSC", "number": "450", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Problems of synchronization, concurrent execution, and their solution techniques.

The rapid advance of computer technology, and in particular, computer graphics, has made new tools available to the scientist to aid in the interpretation and communication of scientific information. In this course students will study a variety of computer graphics, scientific visualization, and virtual reality techniques and apply them to scientific visualization projects. The projects will be drawn from all of the sciences and the resulting projects will then be available to faculty and students to use as tools in their disciplines.The prerequisites for this course are CMPSC\u00a0122. Students will apply the writing skills gained in ENGL\u00a0202C and refine them in the context of scientific writing.

CMPSC\u00a0464 Introduction to the Theory and Computation (3)CMPSC\u00a0464 introduces students to an essential part of theoretical computer science: how to define abstract mathematical models of computational devices (automata), how to characterize their computational power by studying the family of languages that they can recognize (formal languages), and what the limitations of even the most powerful computational devices are (computability). The course studies regular languages by means of deterministic and nondeterministic finite-state automata and regular expressions; it studies context-free languages through the use of context-free grammars and pushdown automata; and it studies computability by means of Turing machines and recursive and recursively-enumerable languages. The unsolvability of the halting problem for Turing machines is proved by a diagonalization argument, and this result is then used to show that various problems about languages are unsolvable, such as the problem of determining whether two context-free grammars generate the same language. Finally, the concept of computational complexity is introduced, and the classes P and NP are defined. (Informally, the former class consists of problems that can be solved computationally in a manageable amount of time, and the latter consists of problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in a manageable amount of time.)
