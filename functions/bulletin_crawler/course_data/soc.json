Popular culture is pervasive in modern societies and comes in many forms both in and out of the mainstream ¿ from pop songs, TV series, and fashion trends to Manga, Burning Man, and Furries. Thanks to social media and the Internet pop culture morphs and spreads rapidly from person to person, across time and space, making it a global culture. As a scientific approach to studying the moving parts that make societies tick, sociology is well suited to helping us make sense of a topic this diverse and complex. To make the topic of pop culture more manageable for a single course, students will explore how popular culture is shaped by the social dividing lines commonly found in modern societies and in turn helps to shape how factors such as race, social class, gender, sexuality, and nationality affect people's lives. The course is organized to meet two instructional goals. First, to demonstrate to students how questions about pop culture stemming from varied sociological perspectives can be answered using different research methods. Second, to help students think sociologically about pop culture by helping them to conduct their own investigations of types and aspects of pop culture that they are curious about. Along the way the class will discuss such issues as creativity and innovation in culture production;the commercialization of popular culture; cultural capital and social distinctions; popular culture as an identity resource; the political uses of pop culture; subcultural deviance; music scenes; cultural colonialism and hybridization; YouTube stars, \"binge-watching,\" and the latest pop culture trends and developments. The hope is that by studying popular culture as part of social processes and human relationships students become more sociologically savvy observers of their cultural environment and gain a richer awareness of the significance of popular culture in their own lives.

In some cases, it is presented as a troubled, violent, dangerous place, as a place permeated by long-standing hatred between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. In others, the focus is on the state's role as the center of Judsiam--a home of the \"chosen people\" and the source of inspiration for one of the world's great monotheistic religions. Some present it as a model for how a democracy can succeed under trying demographic, historic, and geopolitical circumstances. Others frame Israel as a place of conflagration (armageddon) that will usher in a messianic period or as a nation-state with a discriminatory regime that privileges its majority population over its minority and administers oppressive policies over Palestinians in the occupied territories it captured in the 1967 War. While there are elements of truth in each of these presentations, the full picture of Israeli society is much richer and more complex. This course teaches students to cut through the mythology, and develop a more accurate understanding of what Israel is in the 21st century. Since Israel is a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse society, it is only possible to understand the true nature of modern Israel through exploring the many sub-groups that comprise the Israeli citizenry.

The course focuses on the social construction of gender and the impact of gender on experiences in a variety of social contexts and institutions throughout the life course, including cross-cultural comparisons of gender expectations. An overriding objective is to help students better assess and analyze the effects of gender throughout history and in their everyday lives. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures, discussions, group exercises, guest speakers, and films designed to engage the students in the learning process. Each session helps students to critically evaluate the effects of gender discussed in their readings and experienced in their everyday lives. The evaluation tools used for this course extend this critical evaluation. Although the specific evaluation methods vary by sections, all sections use some form of reaction papers, book reviews, and/or journals. These writing assignments require students to demonstrate an understanding of the class readings, lectures, and activities, and to offer an evaluation and assessment of these readings and presentations.

Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: CRIM 201", "General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"course_name": "SOC 205N: Critical Race Theory in the Humanities and Social Sciences", "department": "Sociology (SOC)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course closely examines the place and power of race in America.

While emphasis is given to the inequality and discrimination experienced by local and national populations, a significant portion of the class will address issues rooted in international structures and institutions. Students are evaluated on quizzes, reaction papers, and analysis journals. AFAM 409 / SOC 409 is not a required course in Sociology; it is, however, an optional 400-level course for all majors and minors that fulfills one of their upper-level course requirements. AFAM 409 / SOC 409 is not required for the major or minor, but it is one of several optional courses from which they can choose to fulfill major and minor requirements.", "prerequisite": "3 credits in Sociology", "other": ["Cross-listed with: AFAM 409", "Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences", "United States Cultures (US)"]}, {"course_name": "SOC 411: Racial and Ethnic Diversity and the American Family", "department": "Sociology (SOC)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course will explore the nature and determinants of racial and ethnic variation in family processes in the United States.  HD FS 416 (SOC 411) Racial and Ethnic Diversity and the American Family (3) During the last several decades, the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population has changed dramatically. At end of the 20th century, non-Hispanic whites accounted for less than 75 percent of the U.S. population. While blacks remained the largest minority group, there were nearly as many Hispanics as blacks, and the number of Asians was increasing. Population projections indicate that by the middle of the 21st century, Hispanics will make up nearly one-fourth of the U.S. population. Blacks, Asians, and American Indians together will comprise an additional fourth of the population. The last several decades have also brought significant changes in family life in the United States, including declining rates of marriage, a rising age-at-marriage, an increase in cohabitation, and a dramatic rise in the proportion of births outside of marriage. While these trends in family life have been experienced by all racial and ethnic groups, there is substantial variation in family patterns by race and ethnicity. The course will build on other courses in social inequality and the family. The course does not overlap with any existing courses in the Department of Sociology or with courses offered in other relevant departments.This course will explore the nature and determinants of racial and ethnic variation in family processes in the United States. The student will read articles from major sociological journals and learn to extract major points and issues. He/she will learn to synthesize and critique various arguments on major issues in the field. The student will acquire skills in summarizing and evaluating arguments in essay form. He/she will also develop oral presentation skills. Final grades for the course will be based on class participation, a brief (approximately 5 pages) paper, a group presentation, a midterm examination (essay format) and a final examination (essay format).

Attention will be devoted to recognizing both intended and unintended consequences of family policies and understanding policy challenges and trade-offs. Students will gain an understanding of how policies are shaped by both facts and myths, as well as our values. Students will examine historical and current trends in family patterns (e.g., divorce, women's labor force participation, nonmarital births) to understand the implications they hold for individuals, families and society. Students will gain an awareness of the social, economic, historical, legal, and political contexts within which family policies exist and are proposed. Although the main focus is on U.S. family policy, some time will be devoted to learning about family policies in other countries. We will learn about several specific family policies in-depth (e.g., welfare), but a final goal is to help students develop a general way of looking at family policy that they can then use to understand any issue of family policy that unfolds throughout their lifetime. This course will foster thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, writing skills, research skills, and skills of synthesis, logic, and argument. Course goals will be accomplished through course readings, writing assignments, lectures, class discussions, debates and group projects. Mastery of course material and student evaluation are assessed in several ways. Students will take a midterm and final exam that cover lectures, class discussions, and assigned readings. Two papers are also required. The first paper is based on an analysis of newspaper articles dealing with family policy issues that students will collect and relate to course materials. The second paper is a literature-based analysis of a family policy in a society outside the United States.

This will cover diverse substantive topics such as racial segregation, housing and labor markets, exposure to risks (e.g., pollution, crime, NIMBY facilities) and access to resources (e.g., supermarkets, schools, and health care). The lab component introduces undergraduates to geographic information system software and basic spatial analysis. The lecture component of the course has four main sections. In Section 1 the focus is on fundamental questions such as: Why inequality? How to measure inequality? What are the key dimensions of inequality? This section will be wrapped up by an overview of the causes and consequences of inequality. In Section 2 the focus is on inequality between nations and inequality within nations (i.e., non-US). Section 3 will focus on the United States and specifically examining different levels or \"territories\" of inequality; neighborhood-level to state-level differences. This section focuses on urban spatial inequality and issues such as spatial segregation, access to services and exposure to risks. Section 3 concludes with discussions of rural inequalities focusing on access to health services. Section 4 focuses on 21st century challenges regarding rapid urbanization in the developing world and revisits themes related to \"Global\" inequality.

JST 457 / ANTH 457 / SOC 457 Jewish Communities: Identity, Survival, and Transformation in Unexpected Places (3) (US;IL) This course addresses an understudied aspect of Jewish experience. It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State's Jewish Studies Program. This course will complement the current offerings in Jewish Studies, strengthening the social, cultural, and contemporary perspectives available in the Program. It will provide students with an opportunity to explore individual experience and micro-level processes among Jews, and to study the dynamics of identity and survival. It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses.
