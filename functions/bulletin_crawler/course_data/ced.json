They require working within a social and ethical context because their resolution typically requires individual and institutional change, and they are relentless; Wicked Problems can't be solved \"once and for all.\" It is easy to feel overwhelmed by such problems, as if little can be done. Yet there are ways to work proactively and effectively on such problems, 'living your solutions locally.' This discussion-based interdomain course explores how people are addressing Wicked Problems, examining the 'Right Thing to Do' from several dimensions, including (1) what is ethically appropriate to do in response to a Wicked Problem (and how perspectives on this vary); and (2) the social and behavioral means people use to address such problems. In the course students explore the complex nature of Wicked Problems, including how these are shaped by social, political, and other factors. The rules matter. Students then learn major concepts of justice which commonly are applied to such issues, how these views vary across people affected by the problem, and the importance of recognizing other peoples' perspectives. Students use case studies to explore and critique strategies for engaging Wicked Problems, and how these are used by people working to address these issues. Finally, students work together in small learning teams to analyze a Wicked Problem of their choice, including how various stakeholders view the problem and its potential solutions, and how practitioners are addressing the problem through social and behavior means.", "other": ["General Education: Humanities (GH)", "General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"course_name": "CED 152: Community Development Concepts and Practice", "department": "Community Environment and Development (CED)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Community development is broadly recognized as a process by which places (cities, small towns, neighborhoods) and the people in them, improve their economic and/or social well-being.

The practice of community development requires the ability to identify and understand the interrelationships of economy, society and environment locally, nationally and globally. Community development hinges on the capacity of local communities and residents to influence and determine their own futures. Students will gain an introduction to the concepts and models of community development and will become familiar with the roles of community development practitioners in developed and developing country settings. They will be able to identify the consequences of development strategies for social, economic and environmental well-being, focusing on the interrelationships of these aspects of development. Students will be introduced to strategies to identify capacity and resources available in communities and those that need to be enhanced. Models of decision-making will be introduced and students will work in teams in class with a focus on successful team functioning, identifying commonalities and shared interests to foster decision-making, and being able to extend that experience to working with groups in a community. Students will gain knowledge and understanding of the relevant concepts, processes and practice through readings and in-class lecture and discussion. Case studies of specific community development issues will give students the opportunity to apply the concepts and skills they learn in class, and to work in teams where students take on perspectives of different stakeholders and attempt to reach a resolution.

Two weeks are dedicated to reviewing selected challenges facing the food and agricultural system to underscore the complexity of these issues and illustrate how they have been approached and analyzed by different disciplinary fields. The next two weeks of the course are devoted to critical exploration of theoretical and policy models for understanding how food systems function and change. These conceptual and analytical tools are then applied in three subsequent course modules, focused on 1) Changing Agricultural Production Systems; 2) Changing Food and Farm Work; and 3) Changing Food Consumers and Eaters. Each of these three - week modules will focus on 3 - 4 cases of change efforts either led from \"above\" through government policies or business initiatives or from \"below\" by grassroots groups or social movements. Cases will be selected to compare and contrast U.S. contexts with other international contexts and to highlight the diverse experiences and perspectives across racial - ethnic, class, cultural and gender differences within the food and agricultural system. The course will conclude by synthesizing ideas and insights about the limitations and potentials of different approaches to food systems change. In the last week of class, students will also give \"lightning talks\" distilling their learning about food systems change through an individual semester long field - project with a local or regional community group, business, agency or farm.", "prerequisite": "AG BM 170", "other": ["Cross-listed with: FDSYSÂ 442"]}, {"course_name": "CED 445: International Development Practice", "department": "Community Environment and Development (CED)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "The goal of this 400-level course is to facilitate students' development of the hands-on skills and practical knowledge needed to engage successfully in international development work in the public, private, and non-governmental sectors.

The elements and issues they consider as important elements within social and environmental justice, and how they weight each element, can vary significantly across stakeholders. The terminology used to describe this work similarly differs (i.e. sustainability, social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate social responsibility, etc.), which can lead to misunderstandings.  This course examines the differing perspectives that consumers, investors, businesses, labor, government, and others have towards social and environmental responsibility, and the differing roles that each stakeholder plays. Such roles can range from individual choices about what to purchase and consume, where to invest, and where to work, to collective and organizational choices, such as about what services or products to offer, how these are produced, and where/how supplies are obtained. The course uses institutional and behavioral economic concepts of the interdependent nature of the market, as a theoretical framework for understanding the interdependence of various stakeholders' opportunities and decisions, and the influence of the public policy.", "prerequisite": "6 credits of CED coursework", "other": ["Writing Across the Curriculum"]}, {"course_name": "CED 462: Corporate Social and Environmental Performance", "department": "Community Environment and Development (CED)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This seminar-style course uses speakers from a range of stakeholder groups to highlight and discuss the performance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs in industry.

Often, however, the social component receives the least amount of attention. Many projects lauded for their sustainability benefit only a privileged few. Alternately, the framework of just sustainability places issues of equity and social justice at the center of the discussion. It requires that we ask, first and foremost, who wins, who loses, and who decides. As community development (CD) scholars and practitioners, we are in a position to integrate these questions-and a vision of just sustainability-into our work. Central to this task is working in partnership with community members to identify problems, to ask questions, and to develop solutions. All community change efforts need good information, and good information comes from research. This course introduces students to participatory research methods, placing special emphasis on research ethics, the positionality of the researcher, and embedding research within CD practice. We will focus on research design within the context of a community project, data collection, data analysis, and the dissemination of results. We will cover various approaches to measuring community phenomena, including basic interview techniques, focus groups, observation, surveys, participatory mapping, and other qualitative analytical methods", "prerequisite": "CEDÂ 230"}, {"course_name": "CED 475: CED Integrated Capstone Experience", "department": "Community Environment and Development (CED)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "A well-designed capstone experience provides students with a valuable reflective and integrative experience as they complete their baccalaureate degree programs.

Like the CED program more generally, this course relies on case studies to help students apply the skills that they have learned to actual cases that challenge communities and regions in developed and developing areas of the world. The CED program is also designed to include experiential-learning exercises throughout the program; this course engages students in a significant in-depth experience or project that will vary year-by-year. The experience could be in the United States or in another country. The project will be hands-on and action-oriented.
