[{"course_name": "JST 4: Jewish and Christian Foundations", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course seeks to help students better understand the Bible and appreciate its role as an authoritative collection of sacred texts for Jews and Christians. The Bible is a difficult book, one that is demanding on many levels. In order to read the Bible intelligently, it is important to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of the biblical writings. This course explores the history and geography of ancient Near Eastern civilizations that shaped the experience of ancient Israel and, later, the Greek and Roman imperial contexts that shaped Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. The focus of the course, however, is on the biblical narrative itself and the particular ways that the story of Israel and its covenant with God was represented in scripture: in tales, poems, hymns, dialogues, and genealogies. A basic goal of the course, then, is to promote intelligent, well-informed reading of the Bible. Also important is the willingness to read the Bible closely and critically, with a view toward larger questions raised by biblical texts: how is God to be known and understood? What is the purpose of human life in the world? What moral obligations ought to structure our common life? Does human history have direction and purpose? What is the good and how do we follow it? The Bible takes up these questions and many more. Though an ancient anthology shaped by the succession of Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman empires, the Bible is not merely a product of its original contexts. Millennia of transmission and interpretation have made it a product of history in a much more extended and dynamic sense. In this course, we will examine larger questions raised by the biblical writers and consider the ways that the Bible has shaped, informed, and guided Jewish and Christian ways of life.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: CAMS 4, RLST 4", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "Bachelor of Arts: Other Cultures", "International Cultures (IL)", "United States Cultures (US)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"]}, {"course_name": "JST 10: Jewish Civilization", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course explores the life of the Jewish people from Biblical times on, emphasizing cultural, religious, and institutional developments.

Jewish tradition goes back thousands of years, and Jews have resided in many different lands. They have become an integral part of many different cultures, yet have often retained (or been forced to retain) a certain degree of separateness or difference. In this course we will trace continuity and change in Jewish traditions from ancient to modern times, and across different regions. Taking into account inter-cultural contact and historical events -- ranging in place from the Middle East to Muslim Spain to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and in time from the ancient world to the medieval era, the Holocaust, and contemporary Israel and the U.S. -- we will explore developments in Jewish history, literature, and culture. The course considers topics such as the attitudes other groups have had toward Jews (and vice-versa), the question of whether Jewish identity is a race, a religion, or an ethnicity, the dilemmas Jews face today, and the ways that Jews in many diverse settings have balanced change and continuity. We will explore the factors that shape Jewish experience in different times and places, the diversities within and among Jewish lifestyles, and the ways in which events and interactions with other peoples have influenced the development of Jewish civilization. Finally, we will consider the dilemmas Jews face today in terms of the preservation of their identity and traditions. The course includes class discussion.

Through an integration of numerous disciplines, including historical geography, archaeology, ancient history, biblical studies, epigraphy, and anthropology, students will investigate the interaction between the cultures of the ancient Near East and the religious traditions that developed in the lands associated with the Bible, a relationship that continues to shape the region and the world until today.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: CAMS 12N, RLST 12N", "Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "Bachelor of Arts: Other Cultures", "Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences", "International Cultures (IL)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning", "GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"]}, {"course_name": "JST 60N: Society and Cultures in Modern Israel", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Israel is often portrayed in media and popular society in incomplete or distorted terms. In some cases, it is presented as a troubled, violent, dangerous place, as a place permeated by long-standing hatred between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians. In others, the focus is on the state's role as the center of Judsiam--a home of the \"chosen people\" and the source of inspiration for one of the world's great monotheistic religions. Some present it as a model for how a democracy can succeed under trying demographic, historic, and geopolitical circumstances. Others frame Israel as a place of conflagration (armageddon) that will usher in a messianic period or as a nation-state with a discriminatory regime that privileges its majority population over its minority and administers oppressive policies over Palestinians in the occupied territories it captured in the 1967 War. While there are elements of truth in each of these presentations, the full picture of Israeli society is much richer and more complex. This course teaches students to cut through the mythology, and develop a more accurate understanding of what Israel is in the 21st century. Since Israel is a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse society, it is only possible to understand the true nature of modern Israel through exploring the many sub-groups that comprise the Israeli citizenry. The course looks at Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews (both religious and secular), Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis, Russian-Israelis, Bedouins, and Druze. For each group, it looks at demographics, background histories, migration patterns, institutions, cultural norms, values, and practices.

What did he mean when he proclaimed the coming kingdom of God? Because almost all of our source material espouses Jesus as the Christ of Christian faith, the first step is to understand the aims and perspectives of these Christian sources, including the canonical Gospels as well as non-canonical Gospels.

CMLIT 113 / JST 113 / CAMS 113 / RLST 113 Myths and Legends of the Jews (3) (GH;IL) The impact of the Bible on Western Culture is immense. Beyond its religious importance, the motifs and images from its myths and stories permeate literature and art, providing a basic frame of reference that for much of history could be taken for granted. A degree of familiarity with these motifs so as to be truly fluent is no longer common, and so it requires special effort to discern allusions to biblical traditions. Moreover, these traditions are not static: religious communities continually re-interpret them and appropriate them in very different contexts. Many prominent traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not appear explicitly anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, but are the product of imaginative and ingenious interpretation and re-tellings. Why, for example, is Noah an example of a righteous person in Christian tradition, but in rabbinic tradition is more often portrayed as a profane, earthly-minded man who was saved only because he was the least bad of an evil generation? Why is Moses commonly portrayed with horns in medieval art? Underlying such different traditions are centuries of debate and reflection on these texts as sacred scripture, and competing religious communities often authorized their distinctive beliefs and practices by reading them into scripture. The differences are often too subtle to discern apart from careful comparison. This course will explore the boundaries between Scripture and tradition by means of a close examination of the myths and stories in the Hebrew Bible and their subsequent interpretation and re-tellings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Using methods from comparative mythology and folklore, as well as comparative midrash, our procedure will be to compare these traditions closely with the biblical text, asking: What are the main motifs in the mythology of Judaism? Does Judaism have a coherent mythology? How do their myths compare with the myths of their neighbors? Where did these myths come from? How do these traditions relate to the Bible? What was the function of these myths? Why are there competing myths? How is it possible that Judaism affirms belief in only one God, but has myths that include other divine beings? We will also compare with later interpretive traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). Can we trace trajectories of interpretation? Can we discern particular interpretive methods in operation? We will seek to answer: what do these re-workings of the traditions tell us about the development and function of Scripture, and the social circumstances of the communities? Finally, we will seek to detect reflections of these interpretive traditions in literature and art from the medieval to the modern periods. The course is organized around major topics in the Jewish Scriptures: God, creation, heaven and hell, Torah, Sabbath, Abraham and other ancestors, Israel and holy land, exile, and Messiah.

The course will begin with an analysis of the polytheistic religious milieu of the Ancient Near East in the second and first millennia B.C.E., and will consider the question of how, when, and why belief in one God first appeared in ancient Israel.

In form and structure, the course is historical, following figures and events in a more or less chronological sequence and taking up questions of causality, influence, and social identity. Yet the course is also concerned with the ideas, concepts, and philosophical viewpoints that have shaped Christianity and given it a certain intellectual coherence over time. The course begins with first-century construals of messianic identity and also with the figure of Jesus, as he was portrayed in the New Testament gospels. It then follows the first generations of the Christian movement, considering it within the context of first-century Judaism and the early Roman empire. Topics include persecution, martyrdom, and the important contributions of Origen. The middle section of the course looks at the second, third, and fourth centuries through three lenses, as it were: the office of bishop, the rise of monasticism, and the realities of empire. Bishops, monks, and emperors all shaped Christianity in essential ways, creating a rich and complicated spiritual, moral, theological, intellectual, and geo-political legacy for generations to come. The final third of the course looks at the development of Christianity beyond the fourth century in geographical groupings including churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, western Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavic lands.

The United States has absorbed large numbers of Jewish immigrants hailing from many parts of the world, holding many different ideas about Jewish practice, and affiliating themselves with many different political, social, and cultural traditions. Moreover, Jews have settled and made homes in a wide variety of American communities.

Eventually, minted money- i.e. coinage- came to supplant money in other forms, replacing barter as the primary means of exchange in economies around the world. Coinage became a tool of governments to impose taxation upon their subject peoples, and to spread propaganda about governmental goals or issues. Coins are works of art, but they are common, widely circulating \"works of art\" which also accomplish a daily monetary function to run commerce and the monetary system of an economy. Coins are also historical records, containing valuable information for the historian who is attempting to reconstruct the history of another time or place.

It is an investigation of the development of coined money in the ancient world, with special investigations into (1) how coins were struck and used in Phoenicia of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE; (2) the variety and early uses for coins in the Greek city states of the 6th-4th centuries BCE; (3) the development of Jewish coins in the Holy Land, from Persian times to the period of the 2nd Revolt (early 2nd century CE); and (4) the development of coinage in the Roman economy of the 1st-5th centuries CE.Photographs of coins will enhance class work. With the cooperation of the Palmer Museum, on Penn State's University Park Campus, the class will have access at several points during the semester to view and work with coins from the Palmer's collection of ancient Jewish coins Students will leave the course with a new understanding of what coins are, how they developed, and what they can teach us about ancient history and economics.", "other": ["Cross-listed with: CAMS 210", "International Cultures (IL)", "General Education: Humanities (GH)"]}, {"course_name": "JST 220: Global Diaspora and Exile", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Introduction to and survey of the Jewish and other Diasporas around the world.  HIST (J ST) 220 The Jewish and Other Diasporas (3) (GH;IL) The long dominant view that the Jewish experience since antiquity defines Diaspora as a concept has been challenged in recent years. The meaning of the term Diaspora and related terms, especially (ethnic and/or national) identity and (ethnic and/or national) community, is a matter of much debate across disciplines. The longevity and diversity of distinct Jewish communities around the globe make the Jewish case a particularly interesting subject for study. In a wide geographical, chronological and disciplinary comparative sweep, the course will explore the diverse nature of ethno-national and ethno-religious diasporas (and sub-diasporas), their position, their place of origin (\"homeland\") and their new surrounding culture and society. More specifically, the course will analyze how Diaspora communities in Europe, Asia, and the Atlantic world reconstituted their identities as they expanded into new environments and encountered other cultures, from antiquity to the present. Emphasis will be placed on exploration of the intersection of politics and culture in respect to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender and class. A key question guiding the discussions will relate to the usefulness and limitations of the Diaspora concept, especially in regard to the discourse about globalization where the term is often used. The course will begin with an extensive discussion of theoretical texts about the Diaspora phenomenon. This is followed by case studies of several larger Diasporas, ranging from the Jewish, the Greek to the Chinese Diaspora. Several case studies, notably the Muslim Diaspora, the concept of a victim Diaspora, or alternative Diasporas highlight the limitations of the Diaspora concept. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists.

The course identifies factors that led to the establishment of segregated (and often demarcated) districts -and their eventual dissolution (or transformation). The course traces the social and political impact of exclusion within the segregated district, the possibilities of making contacts beyond the district, the function of innovation and cultural production emanating from these urban areas, and the conceptual trajectory of the Ghetto concept from Renaissance Venice to post-industrial Detroit. Cities and states have allowed certain groups to settle within their confines for economic benefit but have imposed severe restrictions to safeguard the respective city's and/or the state's cultural, political, and \"racial\" integrity. The course will present several representative case studies of segregated and demarcated districts in European, North American, Asian and African cities, highlighting strikingly different trajectories and purposes behind the spatial segregation of people categorized as different and threatening but also as useful.

These tenets of the Jewish tradition presently underwrite modern movements concerned with land use and food sustainability, as well as ethical behaviors in food production. The goal of the course is to understand how Jewish tradition can inform and contribute to improvements in the modern food system.The starting point is the ancient world of the Israelites,. Students will study agrarian interpretations of the Hebrew Bible as well as extra-biblical sources and archaeological data. The biblical attitudes toward food, eating, and agricultural practices are then traced into the post-biblical period and rabbinic periods. The course then jumps ahead to the present day, to shed light on a number of modern Jewish agricultural and food initiatives concerned with issues such as healthy land use, sustainability, and justice in food production and distribution. These movements proceed from various interpretations of Jewish law and custom, and illustrate how some modern Jewish attitudes toward food and eating are responsible for reimagining, and in some cases reinvigorating, biblical ideas and practices.At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to identify and understand the historical and theological significance of diet and eating practices of ancient Israelites and will understand the development of Jewish food laws and practices in the post-exilic and early rabbinic eras. Students will be able to evaluate the extent to which ancient Jewish thought has influenced modern Jewish attitudes and actions regarding food and social responsibility, and will be able to envision the ways in which Jewish tradition, both ancient and modern, can contribute to current progress and future improvement in our systems of food production, distribution and consumption.

It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change.

It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses. The assignments will be structured to facilitate preliminary experience in independent analysis, library research, or field research. The course will be offered approximately once a year. Enrollment will be limited to 30 students in order to promote active, engaged learning. Evaluations will be based on short papers and outlines that will prepare students for their final, term papers.", "prerequisite": "Three credits in JST, ANTH, or SOC", "other": ["Cross-listed with: ANTH 457, SOC 457", "International Cultures (IL)", "United States Cultures (US)"]}, {"course_name": "JST 468: Jewish Philosophy", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Explores major figures and trends in Jewish philosophy and their influences on other philosophical traditions.  J ST (PHIL) 468 Modern Jewish Philosophy (3) The primary objective of this course is to encourage students to have a reflective stance on Jewish thought. Students will learn what comprises Jewish thought and how it is distinguished from theology. They will learn what role religion plays in philosophical thought and what is at stake for a philosophy that emerges from a particular religion. This course will give students perspective on how Judaism links to other philosophical movements, for example, the enlightenment of the modern period. It will enable to think about Judaism from a theoretical perspective, adding a new dimension to what they might study from historical, sociological, or literary viewpoints. Some questions we will consider include: In what ways does it converge/diverge, with the philosophical strains that influence it? In what ways have particular events in history shaped Judaic thinking? Does Judaism, or Judaic thinking, have an essence? If so, what is it? What does Judaism mean for the Jews, and what does it mean for others? And finally, what role does mysticism have in the play between religion and philosophy? Students will be evaluated by written work (short papers and a longer seminar paper) and a class presentation.", "prerequisite": "one course in Philosophy and/or Jewish Studies", "other": ["Cross-Listed"]}, {"course_name": "JST 473: The Contemporary Middle East", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Political, economic, and social changes in Turkey, Iran, Israel, and the Arab countries in the twentieth century; Arab-Israeli conflict.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "Bachelor of Arts: Other Cultures", "International Cultures (IL)"]}, {"course_name": "JST 474: Hiroshima & the Holocaust in History and Memory", "department": "Jewish Studies (JST)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "The history and memory of the Holocaust and Hiroshima and Nagasaki are often taught separately in different disciplines.
