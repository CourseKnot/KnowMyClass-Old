The first cyber-defense skill is on configuring an ACL (Access Control List) firewall. This module provides the students with a practical exercise applying their analytical skills to properly configure the ACL of a firewall and to verify the correctness of their firewall configurations. Through this exercise, the students also learn firewall oriented network security policies. The second cyber-defense skill is on implementing a host-based intrusion detection software tool which can detect suspicious user sessions on a computer. This module provides the students with a practical exercise applying their programming skills to solve anomaly detection problems. The third cyber-defense skill is on using the Metasploit tool to do penetration testing. This module provides the students with a practical exercise applying their programming skills to do penetration testing. The fourth cyber-defense skill is on implementing a network intrusion detection software tool which can detect suspicious network flows.

This is a writing intensive course, which requires each student to individually document cyber security incidents and communicate the impact of those incidents to the organization. Peer writing evaluation will help students to consider how effective their written communication skills are. Team writing assignments will provide students will the real-world experience of writing portions of organizational documents such as preparedness documentation, documenting the organization of computer incident response teams, documenting organizational disaster recovery plans, and documenting post-incident recovery plans. Students will receive peer feedback on their writing assignments, as well as direct feedback from the instructor with a goal of improving writing skills and conforming their writing styles to the expectations of organizations and industry.", "prerequisite": "CYBER 262", "other": ["Writing Across the Curriculum"]}, {"course_name": "CYBER 362: Cybersecurity Analytics Studio", "department": "Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations (CYBER)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Cyberattacks involve advanced and sophisticated techniques to infiltrate corporate computers, networks and enterprise systems and critical infrastructures. Types of attacks include advanced malware, zero day attacks and advanced persistent threats. Advance warning about attackers and intelligence about the threat landscape is considered by many security leaders to be essential features in cyber-defense. The massive increase in the rate of novel cyberattacks has made data-mining-based analytics techniques a critical component in detecting security threats. Big data analytics in security involves the ability to gather massive amounts of digital information to analyze, visualize and draw insights that can make it possible to predict and stop cyberattacks. This studio course teaches fundamental data-driven cybersecurity analytics skills using programming skills acquired in earlier courses. The course will be divided into three modules. The first module prepares students for security analytics, by refreshing or making them familiar with two popular data analytics programming languages (e.g., R and Python). The second module focuses on understanding the key cybersecurity analytics process including data exploration, data visualization and data preparation and examining popular data mining algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, and neural networks and similar techniques for security analytics. In the third module, students use analytics process and methods for selected cybersecurity problems, such as security breaches, ZeroAccess Infection, Log Analytics, Access Analytics and Web Hacking Analytics. Through this studio course, the students will gain concrete understanding of security analytics processes, methodologies and how to apply these concepts and tools to real-world cybersecurity. A major component of the course will be several hands-on exercises and a final team-based project. Hands-on exercises provide students with knowledge, skills and hands-on experience of learning security analytics process and methodologies to address security problems. The team-based project allows students to apply what they have learned to address real world security threat. This course will incorporate collaborative and action-learning experiences wherever appropriate. Emphasis will be placed on developing and practicing writing and speaking skills through application of the concepts, theories and technologies that define the course.", "prerequisite": "STAT 200"}, {"course_name": "CYBER 366: Malware Analytics", "department": "Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations (CYBER)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Malware Analytics is an intermediate course required for students who are majoring in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations.

The course begins by introducing the foundations of malware, including history, vulnerability, types, analysis methods, and defenses. It then builds on this foundation by teaching students how to address malware issues using analysis techniques such as reverse engineering and static program analysis, as well as how to use analytic approaches such as automatic malware trace classification and clustering. The course relies extensively on hands-on laboratory activities to help students obtain practical experience in malware analysis and analytics.
