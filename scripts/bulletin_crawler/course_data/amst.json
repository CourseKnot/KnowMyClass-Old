AMST 50 The Literature and Lore of Mining (3) (GH)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. AMST 50 is a nontraditional approach to the humanities whose central methodology is a comparative use of literature, lore, and oral history to explore humanistic themes related to the coal mining experience and tradition regionally, nationally, and internationally. Throughout the course, knowledge about the miner and his tradition is derived and synthesized from a variety of sources. During the 15 weeks, students typically read one novel, one play, six short stories, a dozen poems, six essays and articles, and a mining culture and lore anthology. Students also view films and videos, examine historical documents, artifacts, and photos, listen to oral history tapes, and visit a coal heritage site. Central to the course is a three-week segment devoted to preparing students to conduct field research involving an interview of a miner or miner's wife. The other 12 weeks are divided equally to stress poetic, fictional, dramatic, and expository expressions of the mining experience. Students analyze and interpret information collected during the field research and make connections between the contents of the interview and the contents of the national and international literature selections assigned for class. By reading, analyzing, and discussing works of literature, students learn how the mining tradition was an inextricable part of American culture and how it played a vital role in the industrial revolution of America. Issues related to immigration, ethnicity, and the struggle between labor and management are also illuminated. Some universal themes related to the human condition to be explored are: the search for dignity, security, and justice; the struggle against the environment to achieve purpose and meaning in life; the indomitable human spirit versus resignation to fate; and the values of solidarity, brotherhood, and family relationships. Representative authors to be studied who have written about coal mining are D.H. Lawrence (England), George Orwell (England), Franz Kafka (Austria-Czech), Stephen Crane (U.S.) Alexandre Kuprine (Russia), and Emile Zola (France). After reading selections by these authors, students compare and contrast the mining tradition in the U.S. to the mining tradition in other countries, with special emphasis on the coal miner's life style, character, and values. For assessment, students will complete three exams-objective and essay in nature. They will conduct an oral history field research project, prepare three reports, and keep a journal. Class attendance and discussion of the work assigned will also be factors in evaluation.

American art, from the colonial period to the present, is examined through paintings, sculpture, buildings, prints and photographs, as well as exhibitions and national/world fairs. The class places special emphasis upon the predicament of national identity by examining the ways in which the very notion of the \"American\" has historically been highly contested. Special points of emphasis include: negotiations between indigenous, colonial and European artistic styles, representations of and by displaced populations (colonial subjects, Native Americans, African Americans), myths of the American landscape, the cult of domesticity and the gendering of American citizenry, later transatlantic experiences of expatriate artists, conflicts between urban and rural conceptualizations of the \"typical\" American experience, the role of the American avant-garde after World War II, and debates over federal funding for the arts. The course is designed to meet two principal goals. The first is to increase students' powers of visual analysis and help them build a critical vocabulary for discussing an art object's medium, composition, style, and iconography. The second is to foster an understanding of the deep implication of the visual arts in their social and cultural contexts. The course therefore involves significant material relating to political, economic and religious issues. It investigates problems in patronage, function, reception and censorship. It considers such intra- and cross-cultural issues as representations of gender, race, and ethnicity. Requirements include essay exams and at least one paper. As a general education course in the arts, this course provides an introduction to American art to a student of any major. This course has no prerequisite and presumes no prior exposure to fine art.
