At Penn State, we are all familiar with the chant, \"We Are!\" and the purpose of this course is to learn together about ourselves and our collectiveness through creative performance. Improv theater is the performing art of spontaneous, collaborative, embodied story-telling. It is often presumed to be a comedic art form, and while it is true that there are often joyful moments that arise from shared experiences of surprise or upended expectations, we will be studying the disciplined practice of longform improvisational theater, which consists of more sustained, narrative constructions. In longform improv, creative outcomes are just as likely to be serious, or tragic, or thought-provoking, or any number of emotions, but in all cases: what we create together says something about who \"We Are!\" to each other as co-performers and as observers. The course will culminate with a public performance. Throughout the course, students will write and reflect on practitioner and academic readings from the field of curriculum and instruction, which are relevant not only to aspiring professionals in education (e.g., Educators preparing to teach in both formal and informal settings, Instructional Leaders, School Administrators, and Athletic Coaches), but also to university students who will benefit from more scholarly-informed reflection on their own educational experiences. In particular: we will draw from literature on learning theories and epistemologies; curricular approaches to diversity and inclusion; and improvisational pedagogies. We will learn improv theater exercises, but more importantly: we will practice the collective embodiment of an improvisational ethos, such that we develop our skills at affirming difference, embracing risk-taking, vulnerability, and uncertainty, listening without judgment, and attuning to our entanglements with one another. Participants will cultivate skills to be responsive to students and other populations for whom they may be providing care or leadership. These are the skills and practices that contribute to living a wholehearted life-as individuals and as communities.", "other": ["General Education: Arts (GA)", "General Education: Health and Wellness (GHW)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Creative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"course_name": "CI 185: Principles of Social Justice in Education", "department": "Curriculum and Instruction (CI)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "This course explores the foundations of equity-based educational practices and helps students construct individual working definitions of social justice.

Educational environments can pose challenges to students in recovery, and without proper support, students often return to active use of alcohol and other substances, which often invites disastrous life consequences, including educational failure. With the proper supports in place, students often thrive across multiple domains. Recovery High Schools provide access to social systems, coping mechanisms, recreational activities, and pro-recovery peer groups. Collegiate Recovery Programs are expanding rapidly: they are typically low-cost, featuring s small staff, a space on campus in which to meet, a peer-support community, and recovery-protective programming. A growing body of evidence suggests that these programs have very low relapse rates, low attrition, and higher GPAs than their host institutions. The course builds awareness of terminology, especially in relation to stigma-reduction and recovery messaging. It explores various theoretical contexts, including ecological theory and resiliency theory. It explores new paradigms in the management of chronic health conditions, through Recovery-oriented Systems of Care (ROSC) and the expansion of the continuum of care that colleges and universities offer their students to include ongoing support for recovery. Since participation in 12-step recovery programs is very high in RHSs and CRPs, we explore the known mechanisms of 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

The course also examines the way in which educational and recovery curricula complement one another to bring about lasting personal transformations.
