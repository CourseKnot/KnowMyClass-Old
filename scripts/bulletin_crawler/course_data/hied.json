Today's mentors are charged with teaching new students about issues related to the classroom transition from high school to college, mental health, alcohol and drug use and abuse, sexual assault prevention, diversity and inclusion, and more. Beyond the subject matter knowledge required to facilitate these conversations, mentors must have confidence in their ability to speak publicly, think critically, and manage a group of students their age. The foundation of student development and transition theory provided in this course set the stage for both knowledge and skill acquisition in these areas. Once the foundation exists, students will hone their public speaking, critical thinking and multicultural competency skills. Through classroom discussions, personal reflection, and engaging faculty, staff, and advisers throughout the University, this course is designed to assist students in their journey to being a peer mentor. Students will explore their personal strengths, navigate personal bias in regards to the issues mentioned previously, and understand the role all of these play in a successful academic, social and personal transition to Penn State."}, {"course_name": "HIED 396: Individual Studies", "department": "Higher Education (HIED)", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Creative projects, including research and design, that are supervised on an individual basis and that fall outside the scope of formal courses."}, {"course_name": "HIED 397: Special Topics", "department": "Higher Education (HIED)", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest."}, {"course_name": "HIED 490: Exploration of Careers in Higher Education", "department": "Higher Education (HIED)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Foundation of graduate study in the field of higher education.
