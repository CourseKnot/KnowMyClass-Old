Computer vision systems bring together imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms for solving problems in areas such as industrial inspection, medicine, document analysis, autonomous navigation, and remote sensing. The course involves both pedagogical written assignments and computer projects.The beginning of the course gives an overview of computer vision and introduces low level image analysis techniques for binary images. Binary vision systems are useful when the silhouette of imaged objects convey enough information to recognize them. Examples can be found in optical character recognition, chromosome analysis and recognition of industrial parts. Moreover, many techniques developed for binary systems can be applied to gray level or color images. Next, the course covers image segmentation and contours. These topics are the foundation of most computer vision techniques. For an image to be correctly interpreted, it must be partitioned into regions that correspond to distinct objects or parts of objects. First, region based techniques such as thresholding, split and merge, region growing and texture analysis are introduced. Next, edge based techniques using gradient and Laplacian operators are discussed.

In this section techniques using information on spatial and temporal changes are used to design computer vision systems capable of coping with moving and changing objects, changing illumination and changing viewpoints.

E E 481 Control Systems (4) This course presents both classical and modern approaches to the modeling, analysis and control system design for continuous time systems. Students learn how to model both mechanical and electrical systems in the time and frequency domains using differential equations, transfer functions, state space methods and frequency domain (Bode) techniques. The goal of developing linear system models is to facilitate system analysis and control design. Modeling is followed by an in-depth study of systems analysis, including stability, transient response and steady state characteristics. The study of stability involves examining the effects of pole and zero placement, and the Routh criterion is used extensively. In the consideration of transient response characteristics, students investigate rise time, peak time, overshoot, and settling time. The primary steady state feature studied is the error between the reference signal input and the system output, and students learn to characterize steady state error through the determination of system type and computation of the error constants. Design of control systems focuses on altering one or more of the system characteristics by adding compensation. Students employ a variety of root locus techniques, proportional-plus integral-plus-derivative (PID), state feedback, and frequency response methods. Students begin with simple proportional, closed-loop control and examine pole migration through root locus plots. They then learn to apply more robust pole placement techniques using proportional and derivated (PD) control. Next, PID controllers are examined with a number of opportunities for design. After learning the classical control techniques, students then concentrate on state feedback control methods, including the design of partial- and full-order observers. Finally, students learn the relationship between time domain analysis and design and frequency domain (Bode) analysis of both magnitude and phase. This course includes a laboratory in which students use MATLAB and Simulink for modeling, analysis and control system design. A minimum of seven laboratory exercises offer students the opportunity to experiment with nearly every concept in a powerful simulation environment.
