EM SC 100S Earth and Mineral Sciences First-Year Seminar (3) (GWS;FYS) The EMS First-Year Seminar is designed to encourage students to begin the important process of 'thinking for a living.' The primary focus of the seminar is to promote critical reading and thinking skills, and to help students develop effective written and oral arguments. Students learn the importance of reading, sharing ideas and collaborating, through independent and group research, discussion and debate. We want our students to think about some of the major issues facing the world today, the role that science and technology have played in defining and addressing these issues, the way in which present-day thinking has been shaped by the past, and the development of scientific thought. The Seminar's content focuses on communication skills, but these are addressed within the context of issues relevant to the disciplines represented in EMS. As such, the discussions range across topics such as the Earth and its resources; scientific and technical aspects of global habitability; development of the advanced materials necessary for sustaining and advancing civilization in the 21st century; and the social, economic, and political factors that shape and constrain society's view of the Earth system. Students undertake three to five major writing projects throughout the semester, as well as several smaller one to two paragraph written assignments. Grades are determined from their performance on the written papers, oral presentations, and in-class participation. The Seminar is a required course for all EMS first-year students at the University Park campus and, together with English 015 and either English 202 or Speech Communications 100, will satisfy the Writing and Speaking requirements of General Education.", "other": ["First-Year Seminar", "General Education: Writing/Speaking (GWS)"]}, {"course_name": "EMSC 101: Resource Wars", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "\"Resource Wars\" presents an analysis of natural resources and how competition for them shapes national and international cultures and geopolitics.  EM SC 101 Resource Wars (3) (US;IL) The faculty of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences are uniquely qualified to teach \"Resource Wars\", a course that presents an analysis of natural resources and how competition for them shapes contemporary and historical culture and geopolitics. \"Resource wars\" will examine the extent to which the Gulf War of 1991, the explosive conflict between the United States and Islamic extremists, and present engagement in Iraq are manifestations of a foreign policy that comes from a desire for resource security. While the current Iraq war is the most recent manifestation of the clash between US and IL cultures, there are many examples of past resource wars in world history. Although the present conflict in the Middle East is about petroleum, past conflicts involve the entire spectrum of natural resources from gold and diamonds to rubber and tea to water, clean air, and living space. Class discussion will meld the technical aspects of discovery and extraction with its impact on society from a cultural and geopolitical points of view (US & IL).Technical analysis starts with the geology of the natural resource. The extraction, harnessing, or mining of that natural resource and resource transportation come next. The use of that natural resource as a material follows. Of course, short term and long climatic instability may play roles. The human elements (US & IL) involved in the trading and development of the resource lead to both armed interstate conflicts and intrastate disputes. Cultural questions might include how the digital age impact resource control and trade, how global resource distribution impacts energy security and utilization, and how international resource competition impacts the climate. Ultimately, the class is led to an understanding about how scarcity has impacted cultures throughout human history (US & IL).The tentative plan is that each lecture period consists of two parts starting with a moderator (the lead faculty member throughout the entire semester) who summarizes the resource under discussion in a 10-15 minute introduction. Then, appropriate EMS faculty will offer detailed accounts of their particular expertise. This format requires two 75-minute classes per week (30 per semester).The moderator shall be responsible for grading the class including the discussion and written responses in a large classroom format (50+ students) taught in one lecture hall. Active learning shall include discussion sessions with a wireless response pad technology for in-class interaction between student and instructor.", "other": ["International Cultures (IL)", "United States Cultures (US)"]}, {"course_name": "EMSC 121: Minerals and Modern Society", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "Production and use of mineral resources in modern society with an emphasis on the interrelationships and their effect on the Earth system.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Natural Sciences", "General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)"]}, {"course_name": "EMSC 150: Out of the Fiery Furnace", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "3 Credits", "description": "A history of materials, energy and man, with emphasis on their interrelationships.

Three selections are used each term, typically two books and one film. Students consider the subject matter in light of humanistic values, where the science, ideas and history presented in the selected media are critically evaluated relative to the viability of our planet's ability to support life. Opening lessons cover the foundational science of energy and sustainability, with a global perspective and consideration of the human dimension. The science is presented without technical jargon or advanced mathematics, to promote a genuine and sound understanding of these essential concepts for college-level students of all academic backgrounds. Learning units are devoted to each media selection, with all content, activities and assessments within the unit contributing to this concentrated focus. After completing this course, students will possess the foundational science knowledge necessary to evaluate contemporary topics related to energy and sustainability, from the perspective of universal humanity on a planet of finite resources. This knowledge prepares students to develop observations, questions and opinions on topics related to energy and sustainability and to self-express them, in both written and oral presentations, to others with different backgrounds and points of view. Students will have the foundational knowledge necessary to be skilled critical readers of energy and sustainability subject matter, knowing how to raise (and answer) questions related to scientific clarity and soundness and how to test assumptions and scope of arguments, especially as related to inclusion of humanistic values and planetary limits. This knowledge prepares students to be willing and able to avoid entrenched ideology-based positions on issues related to energy and sustainability and to develop, instead, a personal position based in science and data with a humanistic perspective. Students will gain the knowledge of credible resources and organizations for ongoing research related to energy and sustainability and be prepared to participate in public dialogue on some of the most challenging and complicated issues of our time, including activities such as letters to the editor, online commenting, political engagement, and public advocacy.", "other": ["Bachelor of Arts: Humanities", "Bachelor of Arts: Natural Sciences", "General Education: Humanities (GH)", "General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)", "General Education -  Integrative: Interdomain", "GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication", "GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think", "GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"]}, {"course_name": "EMSC 296: Independent Studies", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Creative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses."}, {"course_name": "EMSC 297: Special Topics", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject that may be topical or of special interest."}, {"course_name": "EMSC 299: Foreign Studies", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "1-12 Credits/Maximum of 12", "description": "Courses offered in foreign countries by individual or group instruction."}, {"course_name": "EMSC 302: Orientation to Energy and Sustainability Policy", "department": "Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMSC)", "credits": "1 Credits", "description": "Orientation to goals of the Energy and Sustainability Policy program and resources available to help students succeed.
