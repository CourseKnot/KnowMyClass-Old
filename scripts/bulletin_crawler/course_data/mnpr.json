Physico-Chemical Principles - Thermodynamic, chemical kinetic and transport factors which control hydrochemical processes (leaching; precipitation; adsorption; solvent extraction; ion exchange; electrowinning, electrorefining and electroplating; membrane processes; energy storage and conversion); graphical representation of homogeneous and solid/solution equilibria; chemical reagents.2. Engineering Principles - Reactor design and staged operations; ideal batch, continuous stirred-tank and plug-flow reactors; fluidized bed reactors; electrochemical reactors; multistage separation processes (solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, and gas-liquid systems).3. Process Synthesis - Design of metal separation (extraction, refining, waste treatment) materials synthesis, metal finishing, and energy storage/conversion processes and system-integration of unit operations, industrial practice. Emphasis on closing circuits to minimize or eliminate waste effluents.", "prerequisite": "EME 301", "other": ["Cross-listed with: MATSE 426"]}, {"course_name": "MNPR 496: Independent Studies", "department": "Mineral Processing (MNPR)", "credits": "1-18 Credits/Maximum of 18", "description": "Creative projects, including research and design, which are supervised on an individual basis and which fall outside the scope of formal courses."}, {"course_name": "MNPR 497: Special Topics", "department": "Mineral Processing (MNPR)", "credits": "1-9 Credits/Maximum of 9", "description": "Formal courses given infrequently to explore, in depth, a comparatively narrow subject which may be topical or of special interest."}]
