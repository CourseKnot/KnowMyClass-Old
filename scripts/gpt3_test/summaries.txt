Professor Ashish Venkat teaches a computer architecture course at the University of Virginia. His teaching style has been heavily criticized for being overly difficult and assigning too much work. Students have reported feeling overwhelmed and frustrated due to the difficulty of the course and the expectation that they know things that were never taught. The workload has also increased significantly, with students having to do 10+ hours of problem sets a week in addition to reading, labs, and homework. Venkat's lectures are poorly attended and the average on his second exam was a 48%. He has been accused of victim shaming students who ask for help from the TAs, claiming that they are cheating. His handwriting is illegible, he talks quickly, and his lecture slides are not helpful. His problem sets are described as "horrid, atrocious, and disgusting" and are incredibly difficult, with no resources to help. All in all, students have unanimously agreed that this class should be avoided and that Venkat should not be teaching at the undergraduate level. His attitude and lack of resources have caused students to have a negative experience with him, despite his high salary. It is clear that his teaching and attitude are far from deserving of his salary.
