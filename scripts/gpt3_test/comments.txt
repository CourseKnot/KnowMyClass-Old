I was really nervous taking linear algebra online. I thought that a math class would not translate well online but I was really impressed and thankful by the way Prof. Holt adapted his class. For one, he didn't give any tests instead there were just weekly quizzes which were worth 60% of your grade. I found the quizzes to be a little inconsistent and definitely difficult but all in all manageable. The rest of your grade is made up of homework (completion) and in-class assignments (accuracy) and the in-class assignments are done in groups. I would definitely recommend taking this class sooner rather then later because Prof. Holt really set this class up so that people can succeed even though it is all online. I might even dare to say that this class is easier online then it is in person just because of the lack of tests but I guess there's no way to know for sure. Prof. Holt is without a doubt the best math/stats professor I have had a UVA and I think most people will find him really kind and willing to help. If you need to take linear algebra make sure to take it with Prof. Holt!

Holt is an incredible professor. He teaching is similar to the textbook so you could probably choose to either attend lecture or read the book. I went to every lecture and never read the book. I found his tests extremely fair and the material was taught very clearly. I'm a math major and therefore a fan of linear algebra so I thought the material itself was quite fun. My second class with Holt and would 100% recommend any class taught by him.

I wasn't too excited about being required to take this class as a stat major but Holt is definitely one of the best professors I have had at UVA and although linear algebra is not the most interesting subject, Holt does good job of keeping the class engaging. There are two midterms and a final exam that in total make up 88% of your grade but Holt's tests are incredibly fair and if you prepared for them it wasn't difficult to do well (unlike in other math classes where test averages can be in the 70's). Additionally, there are optional weekly homeworks that are graded on completion and an open notes R coding exam and both of these are basically free points to pad your grade. Overall, if you need/want to take Linear Algebra, Holt is the best professor to have.


Great class for a basic introduction to linear algebra for non-math majors, especially useful in CS or any subject related to data analysis. Professor Holt is a charismatic character that explained contents clearly in class and truly cared for his students. I've had tons of fun and interesting conversations with him both in class and during office hours. The tests are at normal difficulty and are graded fair. There are weekly optional homework, but I recommend doing at least some of them to get prepared for the test.


This course is great for students who aren't really into proof and calculus based math but still need or want to take a math course. Prof Holt is so, so nice and cares about his students. He is also funny and teaches really well. Just paying attention in class is enough, but the textbook is also a great resource. The tests are fair and the homework is optional (but you should still do it for free points because it's only half graded on accuracy). I enjoyed this class and I enjoyed prof Holt!


Going into the semester, I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this class. I hadn't taken a math class since high school, and I had heard horror stories about the department at UVA. Yet Professor Holt managed to make this my favorite course of the semester.

Because the class is focused on applications, there aren't really any proofs, and the majority of lectures are spent working through examples, which is really helpful. Homework assignments are *juuusssttt* long enough to concretize the material in your head, without being excessive. Tests are incredibly fair, Holt is exceptionally generous with partial credit, and grades will usually be posted to Collab within 48 hours. Also, Holt has a "quasi-dutch-knockout" where if you do better on the final exam questions that correspond to the material from your worst midterm, he'll replace the bad grade with the corresponding better section of the final. Also, there is an open-note, open-internet R (programming) exam that basically gives you free points to cushion any exam mistakes.As a whole, this was a very fun, fair class, with a very nice professor. I highly recommend it.


Holt is the nicest guy ever, and he's a really effective teacher. I already used one my free hw skips, and he still let me turn in another hw late bc of an out-of-town interview!! It's not a hard class as long as you pace yourself, but unfortunately it had been 2 years since I took a math class and I forgot how to learn math altogether, and that's practice, practice, practice!! I waited till the last minute to do the hws, crammed the night before, and got a C+. Don't do that, and it would be an easy A/B. He also curves up sometimes (I was supposed to get a C but got a C+). Concepts aren't too difficult to grasp, textbook's solid and helpful, he's a great professor and helpful during OH.


Highly recommended class for non-math majors such as Stat, Econ, and CS for those who need linear algebra. This class was great for me because there were no proofs. The only kind of "proof" that we are expected is the True/False Questions on the exam where you have to explain your reasoning such as proving by counter example, but not a full mathematical proof. Overall, if you are not a math major who needs linear algebra in your area of study, take it with Holt. Fairly easy as he steps through multiple examples in each topic and kind of questions you will encounter in a midterm or final exam. He wrote the textbook but I found it difficult to read. But if you go to class, he literally summarizes the important points and you won't need to read it over. The textbook is only for the homework or if you miss class and need to catch up. There is also a R programming part, but it is open notes (including example R files) and open book so its just free points for grabs. Homework is not graded so you don't have to be stressed to turn it in every time. Just practice these problems a couple nights before the exam and you'll be fine. Holt is also a great professor who explains things very clearly and he is very fair when it comes to exams.


Holt is a great professor. He's the most organized math professor I've ever had. His notes are really easy to understand, and he works you through an example for everything so you're not just bombarded with theorems. Because it's an applied class, those examples help and are expected to be useful for those of us who are not math majors but still have to know the material. His grading is based on a few midterms and a final. The homeworks are not graded, which I really enjoyed. But the homeworks are great practice for the exams, so you should do them. Holt is also just a really nice, personable guy!
